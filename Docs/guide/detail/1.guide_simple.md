# Microservices Architecture - ASP.NET Core Project

## Infrastructure Overview

### System Architecture:
The system consists of the following components:

1. **API Gateway (Ocelot)**
   - **Function:** Routes requests from the client to the appropriate microservices.
   - **Role:** The API Gateway serves as the single entry point for clients, reducing dependencies and hiding the underlying microservices.
   - **Ocelot** is configured to route requests to the appropriate microservices based on defined routes.

2. **Microservices**
   - **Function:** Each microservice handles specific business functionality and communicates with other services over HTTP (Refit).
   - **Structure:** Each microservice will have a base repository for data access.

3. **App Host**
   - **Function:** Manages the overall configuration of the application and launches the services.
   - **Structure:** The App Host contains all the microservices and the API Gateway, and also configures communication between microservices using Refit.

---

### Project Components:

1. **API Gateway (Ocelot)**
   - Configured in `Program.cs` to define routes and forward requests to the microservices.
   
   ```csharp
   public static IApplicationBuilder UseApiGateway(this IApplicationBuilder app)
   {
       app.UseOcelot().Wait();
       return app;
   }
   ```

2. **Microservices**
   - Each microservice contains controllers that handle incoming requests and repositories for data access.
   - Uses **Refit** to communicate with other services.
   
   Example: Service A needs to call an endpoint in Service B:
   ```csharp
   public interface IServiceBClient
   {
       [Get("/api/items/{id}")]
       Task<ItemDto> GetItemAsync(string id);
   }
   ```

3. **App Host**
   - This is where all the microservices and the API Gateway are initialized, and the dependencies for communication between services are configured.
   
   ```csharp
   public class AppHost
   {
       public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
       {
           // Register Refit client for Service B
           services.AddRefitClient<IServiceBClient>()
                   .ConfigureHttpClient(c => c.BaseAddress = new Uri("http://serviceb"));
           
           // Register other services and repositories
           services.AddScoped<IItemRepository, ItemRepository>();
       }

       public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
       {
           // Setup API Gateway
           app.UseApiGateway();
       }
   }
   ```

## Documentation: Infrastructure Components

### 1. **API Gateway (Ocelot)**

- **Function:** The single entry point for client requests, which routes them to the appropriate microservices.
- **Configuration:**
   - Define routes in `ocelot.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "ReRoutes": [
         {
           "DownstreamPathTemplate": "/api/servicea/{everything}",
           "DownstreamScheme": "http",
           "DownstreamHostAndPorts": [ { "Host": "servicea", "Port": 5001 } ],
           "UpstreamPathTemplate": "/servicea/{everything}",
           "UpstreamHttpMethod": [ "Get", "Post" ]
         }
       ],
       "GlobalConfiguration": {
         "BaseUrl": "http://localhost:5000"
       }
     }
     ```

### 2. **Microservices**

#### **Service A (Service1)**
- **Function:** Handles incoming requests and communicates with other services through Refit.
- **Structure:**
  - `ServiceAController`: Handles requests from the API Gateway.
  - `IServiceBClient`: Refit interface to call endpoints from Service B.

```csharp
public class ServiceAController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IServiceBClient _serviceBClient;

    public ServiceAController(IServiceBClient serviceBClient)
    {
        _serviceBClient = serviceBClient;
    }

    [HttpGet("get-item/{id}")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> GetItem(string id)
    {
        var item = await _serviceBClient.GetItemAsync(id);
        return Ok(item);
    }
}
```

#### **Service B (Service2)**
- **Function:** Provides APIs that Service A calls to perform specific operations.
- **Structure:**
  - `ItemController`: Defines API endpoints for Service A to call.
  
```csharp
public class ItemController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("api/items/{id}")]
    public IActionResult GetItem(string id)
    {
        var item = new ItemDto { Id = id, Name = "Item Name" };
        return Ok(item);
    }
}
```

### 3. **App Host**

- **Function:** Provides the central configuration and startup for the microservices and API Gateway.
- **Configuring Refit** for communication between services:
  
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddRefitClient<IServiceBClient>()
            .ConfigureHttpClient(c => c.BaseAddress = new Uri("http://serviceb"));
}
```

- **API Gateway (Ocelot) Configuration** in `Configure`:
  
```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseOcelot().Wait();
}
```

---

## Steps to Deploy and Configure the System:

1. **Configure Ocelot for API Gateway**
   - Create the `ocelot.json` file to define routes from the API Gateway to the microservices.
   
2. **Configure Refit for Inter-Service Communication**
   - Declare interfaces for the services to call and register the Refit client in `ConfigureServices`.

3. **Configure Dependency Injection (DI) for Services**
   - Ensure all services and the API Gateway are registered in the DI container.

---

## Notes

- **Ocelot**: API Gateway that handles routing of requests between the client and the microservices.
- **Refit**: A library that simplifies HTTP communication between services by allowing you to define APIs as C# interfaces.
- **App Host**: The central location where all microservices and the API Gateway are initialized and configured.
